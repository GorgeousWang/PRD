# Files should be here

This folder store keys for different API models.

Three files should be here:
- openai_key
- openai_org_id
- anthropic_key

Each file should only contain only one line, which is corresponding key with no extra newline.
Both `openai_key` and `openai_org_id` are for the OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo).
The `anthropic_key` is for Anthropic API (Claude-1).
